			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>My name is Angelica Fromer and I am a rising senior at the University of Miami. I am currently pursing a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and Public Advocacy with a minor in Philosophy.</p>
			<h2> Travels </h2>
			Last semester, I studied abroad in Prague, Czech Republic. While abroad, I made my way across Europe. I have compiled this blog to offer a glimpse into my past semester. Through these photos, I hope to convince my audience of the inherent beauty of travel and the invaluable experience of a foriegn shore.
			<h2> Future Plans </h2>
			In May, I am taking off to my next journey - 1 month in Italy! While I am there, I will be visiting my family in Naples while also embracing the tourism of southern Europe. On this blog, I have designated an area to share this itinerary with you all!
